Basic set of utilities for use with the Blackberry Playbook Actionscript SDK. 
These have evolved from a bunch of classes that I've used to help me with a few basic Playbook applications. I figured to ease reuse I may as 
well put them in a library and get them out there for others to use and improve.

The library currently contains:
- View management tools        (com.craigshaw.playbook.view)
- Scrolling label control      (com.craigshaw.playbook.components)

Usage:
It's a basic Flex Library Project that links against the Blackberry Playbook SDK libraries. To use it, simply pull the latest version of the source
and then import into Flex Builder. You might have to update the compiler settings to point to your Playbook libraries. On my machine as I write this, they are the 
SWC at

C:\Program Files\Adobe\Flash Builder Burrito\Adobe Flash Builder Burrito\sdks\blackberry-tablet-sdk-0.9.3\frameworks\libs\air\qnx-air.swc

and the SWC folder at

C:\Program Files\Adobe\Flash Builder Burrito\Adobe Flash Builder Burrito\sdks\blackberry-tablet-sdk-0.9.3\frameworks\libs\qnx-screen
 
Create a new Blackberry project and add a reference to the PlaybookUtilities project through the compiler settings. Then you're good to go. Enjoy!
