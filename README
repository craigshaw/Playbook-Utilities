Basic set of utilities for use with the Blackberry Playbook Actionscript SDK. These have evolved from a bunch of classes that I've used over a few basic Playbook applications. I figured to ease reuse I may as well put them in a library and get them out there for others to use and improve.

The library currently contains:
- View management tools        (com.craigshaw.playbook.view)
- Scrolling label control      


Using the library
It's a basic Flex Library Project that links against the Blackberry Playbook SDK libraries. To use it, simple pull the latest version of the source and then import into Flex Builder.
