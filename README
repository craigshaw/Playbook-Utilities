Basic set of utilities for use with the Blackberry Playbook Actionscript SDK. These have evolved from a bunch of classes that I've used over a few basic Playbook applications. I figured to ease reuse I may as well put them in a library and get them out there for others to use and imporve.

The library currently contains:
- View management tools (com.craigshaw.playbook.view)
- Scrolling label control
